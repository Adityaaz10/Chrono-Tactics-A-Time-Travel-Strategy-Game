# Chrono-Tactics-A-Time-Travel-Strategy-Game(Development ongoing)
Chrono-Tactics is an original, team-based strategy game that explores time travel dynamics and strategic decision-making across three eras: Past, Present, and Future. Players compete as rival time factions, making decisions that alter not just their present standing but reshape history retroactively. Combining elements of game theory, negotiation, and creative play, the game challenges participants to balance alliances, technology investments, paradox actions, and timeline manipulation to become the Keeper of Time. Every round introduces new actions—investing in science, forming or breaking alliances, launching attacks, or instigating paradoxes—each with rippling consequences across the interconnected timeline
